# FFXI-FFXIVHotbar

## 🔑 Hotkey

**Default toggle: `Alt+H`**

Press `Alt+H` in-game to show or hide the editor window. Goes through Windower's
`bind` system, so the keybind is automatically suppressed while the chat bar,
search box, or macro editor is open — won't fight with typing.

> The old bare-`H` toggle is gone. A single-letter hotkey consumed that
> keystroke game-wide, so typing an `h` in chat or in a macro name toggled the
> window. The toggle is modifier-based only now.

**Rebind it any time:**

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `//hotbar hotkey` | Show the current combo |
| `//hotbar hotkey ctrl h` | Switch to `Ctrl+H` |
| `//hotbar hotkey alt+k` | Combined form also works |
| `//hotbar hotkey off` | Disable the hotkey; `//xh` still works |

Saved per character. `Ctrl`/`Alt` + a **number** is rejected on purpose — FFXI
claims those for macro slots and eats the keystroke before Windower ever sees
it, so the bind looks fine and silently never fires.

Slash-command equivalents: `//xh`, `//ffxihotbar`.

---

GSUI-styled editor for [aregowe/XIVHotbar2](https://github.com/aregowe/XIVHotbar2)
keybind files. Click a slot, pick a command/action/target from a dropdown,
hit Save. Writes back to your per-job `.lua` file with an automatic `.bak`
backup, then fires `//xivhotbar reload` so the new binding shows up
immediately on the in-game hotbar.

Built so you don't have to alt-tab out to a text editor every time you
want to add or swap a single hotbar slot.

## Requires

- Windower 4
- [XIVHotbar2](https://github.com/aregowe/XIVHotbar2) installed and
  working with a per-character data folder, e.g.
  `Windower/addons/XIVHotbar2/data/<Character>/<job>.lua`

## Install

```
cd path\to\Windower\addons
git clone https://github.com/mullerdane85-hash/FFXI-FFXIVHotbar.git
```

Then in-game:

```
//lua load FFXI-FFXIVHotbar
```

To autoload, add `lua load FFXI-FFXIVHotbar` to `scripts/init.txt`.

## Usage

Press `H` (chat-aware — passes through to chat while typing) or run
`//xh` to toggle the window.

The window shows your **three hotbars × twelve slots** for the current
job. Each slot displays its action label and command type tag. Empty
slots show a `—`.

1. **Click any slot** — opens the edit panel at the bottom showing the
   slot's current cmd / action / target / label.
2. **Click `Cmd ▾`, `Action ▾`, or `Target ▾`** — opens a dropdown
   picker. The Action picker is populated from your actually-known
   spells, your job-level-eligible abilities, weaponskills, and usable
   items currently in your bags. Picking an action auto-fills a
   sensible default command type and target.
3. **Click `Save`** — writes the change back to the `.lua` file with
   a `.bak` saved under `FFXI-FFXIVHotbar/data/backups/<filename>.<timestamp>.bak`,
   then auto-fires `//xivhotbar reload`.
4. **Clear** wipes the slot (writes a `--{...}` commented-out
   placeholder so XIVHotbar2's slot ordering stays intact).
5. **Cancel** discards your edit and closes the panel.

Drag the window by its title bar. Position persists across reloads.

## Commands

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `//xh` (or `//ffxihotbar`) | Toggle the window (same as H key) |
| `//xh show` / `//xh hide` | Explicit show/hide |
| `//xh reload` | Re-read the keybind file from disk |
| `//xh where` | Show the file paths the locator is trying |
| `//xh help` | Command list |

## Visual style

Matches the GSUI / FFXIJSE addons — 3px blue border, dark title bar,
hotbar grid with `Consolas 10pt` text. Active slots have a filled blue
background; empty slots are slate; the currently-selected slot gets a
green tint.

## What it doesn't do (yet)

- **No multi-job tabs.** Edits the current main-job file only. Switching
  job in-game re-reads the new file automatically (on the `job change`
  event).
- **No spell icons in slots.** Just text. Adding the icon pipeline (same
  one GSUI uses) would be a follow-up.
- **No drag-to-rearrange.** Click each slot you want to change.
- **No filter search in the Action dropdown.** It lists every known
  action sorted alphabetically. Keyboard search will be added later.
- **No undo button.** Use the `.bak` files in `data/backups/` to restore
  manually if needed (just copy them over the live file).

## Credits

- **aregowe** for the original XIVHotbar2 addon. This editor only
  modifies the keybind files; the actual hotbar rendering and command
  execution is all XIVHotbar2.
- The locator / writer / dropdown code patterns are reused from the
  author's other Windower addons (FFXIJSE, GSUI2).
